# Balloon Click, more balloons please.

Go Balloon Click! is a game that brings together the simplicity of the classic clicker game and the puzzle game.

It's a game that you can play with your eyes closed, the only thing you need is your brain. Then only to find refresh.

Let's Go!

# Bubble Takeover, You can never win!

For the last few months, I’ve been receiving emails and tweets and comments that all say the same thing:

“Bubble Takeover, You can never win!”  “Bubble Takeover, You can never win!”

I don’t get it. Why would anyone say something like that?
